    <description>This mod requires REPENTOGON. It allows you to move the camera around when the game is paused. Note: this only works in large rooms.

There's 2 ways to interact with this mod:
[list]
    [*]Press the tilde key to open the new debug console and menu. There's a new Shenanigans option that will let you move the camera around the room.
    [*]Press Esc/Start to pause the game. On keyboard, player 1 can use WASD to move the camera. On controller, player 1 can use the right thumbstick to move the camera. You can also use your mouse to click on different parts of the room. If you don't have a cursor then enable Mouse Control via Repentogon's Game Options (and restart the game). Recommendation: install a minimal pause menu mod so you can actually see the room when paused.
